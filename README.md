# Water Quality Analysis and Classification

## Context

This project focuses on analyzing and classifying water quality in an urban environment using an imaginary dataset. The dataset is designed for educational purposes, allowing users to practice and acquire knowledge in data analysis and machine learning.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes related to water quality, where each attribute represents a specific water ingredient. The attributes are all numeric variables and are listed below along with their safety thresholds:

### Attributes

- **aluminium**: Dangerous if greater than 2.8
- **ammonia**: Dangerous if greater than 32.5
- **arsenic**: Dangerous if greater than 0.01
- **barium**: Dangerous if greater than 2
- **cadmium**: Dangerous if greater than 0.005
- **chloramine**: Dangerous if greater than 4
- **chromium**: Dangerous if greater than 0.1
- **copper**: Dangerous if greater than 1.3
- **flouride**: Dangerous if greater than 1.5
- **bacteria**: Dangerous if greater than 0
- **viruses**: Dangerous if greater than 0
- **lead**: Dangerous if greater than 0.015
- **nitrates**: Dangerous if greater than 10
- **nitrites**: Dangerous if greater than 1
- **mercury**: Dangerous if greater than 0.002
- **perchlorate**: Dangerous if greater than 56
- **radium**: Dangerous if greater than 5
- **selenium**: Dangerous if greater than 0.5
- **silver**: Dangerous if greater than 0.1
- **uranium**: Dangerous if greater than 0.3
- **is_safe**: Class attribute {0 - not safe, 1 - safe}

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis and model training
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation
- `models/`: Saved models and evaluation results
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation
